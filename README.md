## Machine Learning API - Beer Recomender App

- Let's create a Machine Learning API that recommends bier based on their preferences.

## How it works?

- The user describes what kind of beer she is looking for. E.g 'I want a low-alcoholic beer, with fruity notes. And gluten free'
- The API returns the top-N beers that fit into the requirements

- To build this project we need NLP to understand the user intent, and match it with the right beer. We will use similarity 'neighbors', and suggest these.
