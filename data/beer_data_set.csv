Double Bag,252,Altbier,8,Long Trail Brewing Co.,"Notes:This malty, full-bodied double alt is also known as “Stickebier” – German slang for “secret brew”. Long Trail Double Bag was originally offered only in our brewery taproom as a special treat to our visitors. With an alcohol content of 7.2%, please indulge in moderation. The Long Trail Brewing Company is proud to have Double Bag named Malt Advocate’s “Beer of the Year” in 2001. Malt Advocate is a national magazine devoted to “expanding the boundaries of fine drinks”. Their panel of judges likes to keep things simple, and therefore of thousands of eligible competitors they award only two categories: “Imported” and “Domestic”.

Scurry,255,Altbier,8,Off Color Brewing,"Notes:Just cause it's dark and German doesn't mean it's an alt. Based on the obscure Kottbusser style of beer, this surprisingly dry beer retains all the aroma and nuance of honey (from bees) and molasses (not from bees) creating a perception of sweetness through cool, controlled fermentation.

Layers of deeply toasted malt are balanced by just enough hop bitterness to make it deceivingly drinkable. Paired with a dry finish, Sleigh’r is anything but your typical winter brew.An Alt ferments with Ale yeast at colder lagering temperatures. This effect gives Alts a more refined, crisp lager-like flavor than traditional ales. The Alt has been “Ninkasified” raising the ABV and IBUs.

Mother’s beautiful brown beer is medium-bodied with caramel, toffee, and subtle chocolate malt flavors—all balanced by moderate hop notes and a clean, dry finish.Three Blind Mice combines components of several malty beers for the unique brown beer experience you've been missing. After lots of research to find the perfect styles for our base, the clear winners were the lighter body and caramel characters of Irish red ales, the soft chocolate and toffee flavors from English brown ales, and the hop component and balance of German altbiers.

Little Red Cap,287,Altbier,8,Grimm Brothers Brewhouse,"Notes:Altbier is German for “Old Beer”, this refers to the “old” style of brewing using an ale yeast (As opposed to a lager yeast fermentation which is a relatively new process). This beer originated in the Westphalia region of Germany in a town named Dusseldorf. Due to the cool climate of Dusseldorf, Altbiers employee an ale yeast that has evolved over time to ferment at somewhat cooler temperature than that of other ale yeasts. This cool fermentation produces subtle yeast derived esters and leaves a clean malty beer. In addition to this cool clean fermentation, altbiers are then lagered at cold temperatures to help smooth and refine the beer. The result of this is a very clean and hoppy red ale.Coming in at 6.2% ABV and IBUs Little Red Cap is an easy drinking hop forward beer worthy of its heritage. We use a bit of Cascade hop to give it an “American Twist” while maintaining its German heritage. This beer won a Gold Medal at the 2011 and 2016 GABF and a Bronze at the 2012 GABF. It also won a Silver Award at the 2016 World beer cup. ",5.2,3.63,25,50,27,39,18,47,52,28,4,24,59,6,100

Scruffy's Smoked Alt,291,Altbier,8,Cedar Creek Brewery,"Notes:Our goal is to have a very drinkable beer with a nice smoked quality that will pair well with food and be something a little different. We blend a good amount of German Rauch malt, that is smoked with beachwood, with a US two-row malt, Crystal 40, Crystal 120 and a bit of Pale Chocolate Malt. We use enough US Magnum & Willamette hops to balance the malty sweetness of the German Alt yeast used to ferment the beer. That leaves moderately smokey notes that comes through mostly in the flavor that is balanced with the slight fruity flavor that the Alt yeast will give you. A very session-able smoked ale with enough bitterness to balance the other flavors.	",5.1,3.68,25,50,18,45,11,29,39,28,3,21,31,130,91

Helldorado,4215,Barleywine - American,97,Firestone Walker Brewing Co.,"Notes:Part of the adventure of aging beer in retired spirits barrels is the synergistic interaction of different malt flavors with the oak and spirit flavors from the barrel. Darker beers like stouts and darker barley wines have typically been the favored candidates for barrel-aging, due to their deeper caramel and roasted flavors. Helldorado breaks that mold with a deep golden color from being brewed solely with English and American pale malts. The bready, honeyed flavors of pale malts pull out rich wildflower honey, vanilla and coconut notes from the oak, creating an overall flavor evocative of bourbon-glazed graham crackers that stands as singularly unique in our Vintage lineup.

The flavors of the beer are at first as overwhelming as the intense Santa Fe sun.

Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4260,Barleywine - English,98,Midnight Sun Brewing Co.,"Notes:Arctic Devil Barley Wine, aptly named after the ferocious wolverine of the north, is an English-style (meaning malt-inclined) barley wine. Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years, it is brewed once a year then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended, bottled and released.In its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.Each annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment.20 IBU	",13.2,4.38,40,60,10,72,69,28,123,23,0,49,23,24,141

Devotion,1704,Blonde Ale - Belgian,42,The Lost Abbey,"Notes:Belgian Style dry hopped Blonde Ale. It’s an unassuming road leading to the priory. Here, off the corner of two intersecting roads, dedicated monks have been making beer for over 150 years. It’s always been a simple life — the kind that requires they brew only enough to sustain the activities of their monastery. In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldn't sustain.Nearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them. Since we aren't sensible enough to locate our brewery near hop fields, we can only offer this blond ale in celebration of our Abbey brethren and their steadfast Devotion.

There is very little of the sweetness that is frequently to be tasted with doppelbock beer.” The Ayinger Celebrator has been ranked among the best beers of the world by the Chicago Testing Institute several times and has won numerous medals.

This German lager beer is rich and malty and brewed to an alcohol strength of 6-7%. “Ice Bock” is produced when a Bock beer is partially frozen in order to increase it’s alcohol content. In this process, some of the water content turns to ice, effectively strengthening the flavor and alcohol of the beer. We take this process one step further. After the initial freezing, the beer is decanted off the ice and frozen a second time. The resulting beer is a deceptively smooth and amazingly strong lager.

Brinkley's Maibock,144,Bock - Maibock,4,Free State Brewing Co.,"Notes:This beer has a very full and complex flavor that is best enjoyed slowly, allowing the different flavors time to develop on your tongue. You will find that it changes as you progress from the first taste to the lingering finish. The malty sweetness is well balanced and blended with hop bitterness, giving a full, rich blend of flavors. A generous quantity of pilsner malt is joined with a little bit of caravienne for color and some carapils for body, along with plenty of Munich malt for flavor and aroma. This beer is lightly hopped with Yakima Perle and German Hallertau.The traditional symbol for bock beers of all varieties is the billy goat. This is the reason that Free State named this Maibock after Dr. John R. Brinkley, a.k.a. ""The Goat Gland Doctor."" In 1920s Kansas, Brinkley gained notoriety for his alleged cure for infertility that involved the surgical implantation of goat glands in the affected individuals. Some farmers are even said to have brought along there own goats because they felt them to have superior sexual prowess.	",6.5,3.6,20,38,9,37,11,41,46,18,1,17,64,5,87
Heller Bock Saphir,145,Bock - Maibock,4,Brauerei Hofstetten Krammer GmbH & Co.

This means we stuffed as many full-cone hops – fresh from the fields – as we could into a lager tank and filled the rest of the space with our bock beer. The beer was then left to mature for two months before it was once again enriched with hop oils.To preserve all the wonderful flavors developed during the process, this beer goes directly into bottles without filtration.Light-golden in color with a mild cloudiness, our Saphir-Bock shimmers tantalizingly in the glass. The floral hop aromas harmonize perfectly with the warm ester notes. When taken to the nose, you may make out hints of mandarin, lychee, and ripe pears. On the tongue, you'll immediately be struck by the full-bodiedness. As it moves back across the palate, the hop notes open up, revealing themselves in all their glory in the finish. The pleasant fruity-bitterness travels up the throat, across the palate, and into the nose, where it is greeted, once again, by the sweet ester notes of the yeast.This constant play between full-bodied maltiness and floral hoppiness ensures an unforgettable drinking experience.

This top-fermented, unfiltered Wheat Bock beer is the counterpart to Bayern’s famous Doppelbock Lager and is decoction-brewed, a technique used often in Bavaria but seldom in the US. The recipe uses five types of malt (Wheat, Pilsener, Carmel, Munich and Chocolate), and has an o.g. of > 17 % Plato, producing a stout 7.5 % Alc. by Vol. As with all Bayern wheat beers, Face Plant surprises with its complex flavor. German Hallertauer Perle hops give this hearty Bock beer a perfectly balanced sweetness.	",7.5,3.88,15,35,10,66,33,34,73,24,0,40,35,21,121

Sanctification,5101,Brett Beer,117,Russian River Brewing Company,"Notes:Who’s afraid of the ""big bad BRETT?"" We’ll tell you who: winemakers! Because of our close proximity to several hundred wineries, we often get winemakers visiting our brewery. (After all, it takes a lot of great beer to make great wine!) Because we use 100% Brettanomyces yeast to ferment Sanctification, most winemakers will only smell the glass, and only a very few will venture to taste the beer. They think the Brettanomyces will attach to their clothing and end up in their winery. A simple solution was offered: keep a smudge pot burning at the door of our brewery so they can burn their clothes when exiting, but even that was not enough. After giving it more thought, we concluded that winemakers think Brettanomyces might scar their taste buds and possible even permeate their skin? Either way, Sanctification is one of the most unique beers you will ever taste! It was fermented with 100% Brettanomyces, rather than the traditional Saccharomyces.

But add a touch of brettanomyces, the unruly beast responsible for the sharp tang and deep funk found in many Belgian ales, and our WildDevil emerges completely untamed. Floral, aromatic hops still leap from this amber ale, as a host of new fermentation flavor kicks up notes of citrus and pine. Pour yourself a glass today—if you dare.

Nightmare On Brett,5105,Brett Beer,117,Crooked Stave Artisan Beer Project,"Notes:Dark sour ale aged in Leopold Bros whiskey barrelsA demonic dark sour, Nightmare on Brett takes on many facets during its transformation to the sour side. Initially aged in large oak foeders with our mixed culture of wild yeast and bacteria, this beer is then transferred to bourbon and whiskey barrels. The various spirit barrels bring on a new life to this beer as it conditions for months, while obtaining additional bourbon and whiskey characteristics. Dominated by dark fruit aromas and flavors, the underlying cacao notes meld with an acidic tart berry finish. With each batch release being a unique blend of barrels, the multiple variations of Nightmare on Brett released throughout the year prove that with creativity and experimentation, anything is possible.

Enjoy After Brett IPA,5107,Brett Beer,117,Stone Brewing,"Notes:This IPA is spiked at bottling with Brettanomyces, a wild yeast that, over time, brings about charmingly unpredictable complexities of spice, funk, acidity and more. The operative words in our beer-cellaring thesis are ""over time."" For those of you who are impatient or like to experiment, the earliest we recommend sampling this beer is one year before the date on the label. The beer won't be fully carbonated until that date. Ideally, you'll want to cellar the beer up to—or beyond—the Enjoy After date to help it reach its full evolutionary potential. At that point, some facets of the Brett characteristics will have mellowed, while others will have become more profound; it all matures into a fascinating and delicious culmination. Individual results will vary...and that's both the beauty and the intent behind this beer.	",7,3.89,0,0,35,36,5,38,49,85,3,63,58,15,21

Brett IPA plays off this piece of brewing lore by pairing Brettanomyces—a yeast that exhibits itself as ripe fruit rather than strong funk or sourness—with multiple varieties of fruit-forward hops.Aromas of citrus, pineapple, and passion fruit meld into tropical flavors that pair nicely with the beer’s lightly hopped body. Maris Otter, Munich malts, and raw wheat balance the floral barrage of Bravo, Cascade, Amarillo, Centennial, Citra, and Galaxy hops. By finishing with a mix of pleasant bitterness and tropical fruit, Brett IPA ushers brewing history into the present.	",7.1,4.12,0,0,28,43,11,63,70,153,1,152,72,7,23

Yet another Barrelworks creation with DBA roots, this beer begins as Double DBA and is selectively matured in bourbon barrels for several months. A further 18 months of secondary fermentation and additional maturation in French and American oak barrels creates unparalleled depth and complexity. This hefty brew is brimming with a full spectrum of flavors and aromas: Nutty sherry aromas mingle with Oak, then give way to a Cointreau-like boozy orange zest. Tart cherries linger as the acidity builds on the palate. Vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon provide a supporting cast. The whole experience is reminiscent of a Manhattan cocktail.

Northern English brown ales tend to be strong and dry, while southern English brown ales are milder and sweeter. Brooklyn Brown Ale combines the best of those classic styles and then adds an American accent in the form of a firm hop character and roasty palate. A blend of six malts, some of them roasted, give this beer its deep russet-brown color and complex malt flavor, fruity, smooth and rich, with a caramel, chocolate and coffee background. Generous late hopping brings forward a nice hop aroma to complete the picture.

Bitch Creek American Brown Ale is named for this local landmark. Since 2004, it’s become one of the most award-winning beers in the industry having claimed 15 gold medals at national events. Bitch Creek perfectly balances big malt sweetness and robust hop flavor for a full bodied, satisfying mahogany ale. Like the stream for which it is named, our Bitch Creek American Brown Ale is full of character... not for the timid.SpecificationsMalts: Idaho 2-Row malted barley, German Melanoidin, CaraAmber, CaraAroma & CaraMunich Hops: Galena, Chinook, and Centennial.

Bellaire Brown Ale,324,Brown Ale - American,9,Short's Brewing Company,"Notes:Bellaire Brown is our flagship Brown Ale. Full-flavored with notes of sweet caramel, chocolate, and toasted malt, Bellaire Brown is balanced with a mild and earthy hop quality. This ale is dark and rich with a medium body. It’s hardly classifiable as a brown, but is certainly considered a delicious masterpiece.Bellaire Brown was originally created to appeal to people who enjoyed drinking coffee, and to beer drinkers who are not interested in hoppy options. When Joe Short was creating the Bellaire Brown recipe, he desired a beer that was meatier and burlier than most browns. Bellaire Brown is a great gate-way beer for drinkers to be introduced to darker beer varieties.19 IBU	",7,3.82,25,45,11,63,10,24,72,5,0,11,22,4,118

We were determined to save our beer, the tank fermented at a higher temperature than intended. As a result, the beer changed from a lager into a California Common beer.The storm’s gift was this DERECHO COMMON™.DERECHO COMMON™ is deep golden in color, and has toasty, biscuity malt flavors. It is medium bodied with an assertive hop profile. It is hopped with Centennial hops, which give it a spicy, citrusy hop kick on the finish.	",4.8,3.69,35,45,27,31,17,65,29,64,3,60,82,11,66

Yoerg's Beer,1196,California Common / Steam Beer,29,Yoerg Brewing Company,"Notes:When Anthony Yoerg came to the United States from Bavaria, the brewing scene was in its infancy and British styled ales dominated production. But Anthony had a different way of making beer. When he first began in Saint Paul, he aged his beer in caves, lagering them for four weeks before he released them to the public. The end result was a smoother, silkier and much more drinkable style of beer.100% steam-brewed, just as it was over 150 years ago, using 100% Minnesota Barley (three different toast levels), Washington State Hops, and a touch of Celeia Hops for aromatics. Yoerg's Beer is a big, malty, roasty/toasty brew with a haunting dance of hops in the background, It's fragrant, powerful, and just might be the most serious lager to come out of the Midwest since, well, since The Yoerg Brewing Company closed their doors in 1952.

Regular Coffee,1206,Cream Ale,30,Carton Brewing Company,"Notes:A Classic Jersey-ism is ""regular coffee."" Here when you oder a ""regular coffee"" at any place you trust to make a pork roll and cheese you get a paper cup of coffee with ""milk and 2 sugars"" rather than a ""black coffee that hasn't had the caffeine removed."" Acidic bitter coffee flattened by milk and sweetened; the perfect foil for the salty unctuous savor of breakfast on a roll. For our homage to Jersey's breakfast beverage, we teamed up with our neighbors at Fair Mountain Coffee Roasters looking for an elevated version of classic crappy coffee. We chose Mexican Chiapas for its bitterness akin to artichoke, roasting it a little darker than usual, along with Ethiopian Sidamo for its pleasant lemon-like acidity, which we pushed up through fermentation. We added this coffee blend to a high gravity golden cream ale, contributing our ""milk and 2 sugars."" Drink Regular Coffee because running over a black beer with coffee is no way to get to work.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AtZGKBsd94&list=UUnN44_ILc3y0x6WbvjLR1Kg ",12,4.26,10,22,13,109,28,144,85,40,5,23,44,31,208

Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,504,Dubbel,14,Brouwerij Westmalle,"Notes:Westmalle Dubbel (7%) is a dark red-brown beer with a rich, complex taste thanks to re-fermentation in the bottle. You pick up touches of caramel, malt and fruity esters reminiscent of ripe banana. The beer pearls beneath a covering of dense, cream-coloured froth. A lovely lace pattern forms on the inside of the glass once emptied. The long, dry finish of this balanced, mild Trappist beer will stay with you.Trappist or Dubbel?In 1865 the monks of Westmalle started brewing a dark Trappist beer in addition to their table beer. They adjusted the recipe in 1926, doubling the amounts of raw ingredients to produce a new, stronger beer. Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called ‘Trappist’. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel.Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tapWe are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles. But around 150 carefully selected Belgian cafés and restaurants serve this beer on tap from barrels containing 20, 30 and 50 litres. In the barrel, this living beer evolves differently to emerge with a slightly sweeter taste.Westmalle Dubbel can also be purchased in 75 cl bottles.

Reposé,1816,Farmhouse Ale - Bière de Garde,44,Jester King Brewery,"Notes:The inspiration for Reposé came from dusty, hay-filled barns like the one near Jester King where we store our aged hops. We attempted to capture some of our sensory experience of the barn by adding ingredients found in the attic to the beer. We added bales of hay to the mash and old hops that had spent many months in burlap bags to the boil. Further providing inspiration for Reposé was Bière de Garde, a traditional French farmhouse beer that likely originated out of the stone-walled barns that dot the landscape of northern France. Bière de Garde was historically brewed in fall and winter to take advantage of cooler fermentation temperatures, and aged for months before drinking. Similarly, Reposé was brewed during February of 2014 and slowly fermented for months prior to being blended and packaged in January of 2015. The wort for Reposé was brewed with Texas Hill Country water from our well, malted barley, hay, aged hops, and fresh hops. It was then pitched with Jester King’s unique mixed culture of brewer’s yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery. After an initial fermentation in stainless steel, Reposé was then slowly fermented for months in Brandy barrels we received from France. It is 8.3% alcohol by volume, 12 IBU, has a finishing gravity of 1.004, and was 3.25 pH at the time of bottling. The label art is by Jester King’s Josh Cockrell.

The beer is fermented with a distinct French farmhouse ale strain, then bottle conditioned with extra sugar and yeast for at least two weeks.Bière de Garde translates to “beer which has been kept or stored”. This traditional, artisan farmhouse ale from Northern France was brewed in early spring and stored in cold cellars for consumption in warmer months. While related to its spicier, tarter Belgian cousin Saison, Bière de Garde is a richer, sweeter beer.20 IBU	",7,3.86,20,30,12,46,25,24,101,99,0,93,37,29,77

Good Harbor Golden Ale,1829,Farmhouse Ale - Bière de Garde,44,Leelanau Brewing Company,"Notes:This Golden Ale is Inspired by Franco-Belgain bière de gardes, but not exactly fitting the profile of its European counterparts, this beer is best described as a Michigan Bière de Garde. Hand-crafted by Ron Jeffries at his Jolly Pumpkin Brewery in Dexter, which is consistantly rated as one of one of the best in the world, all of the Leelanau Brewing Company beers are distingushed by their time spent in a large French oak barrique prior to bottling and re-fermentation. The wild yeasts inhabiting the brewery give all the beers made there a common thread, creating a family of beverages with rare harmony, despite their diverse styles.Decidedly refreshing despite the 7.5% abv, this style of beer was originally brewed in the slow winter season as payment for farmhands in the summer. We certainly don’t mind sitting down after a long day of work and breathing deep the symphony aromas wafting from the lofty, lacey head burgeoning from our tulip glass. Subtle notes of peaches, apricots, canned pineapple, bitters, and a faint herbaceousness belie the smooth and delicate taste. The slightly malty, fruity body quickly transitions effortlessly to a crisp, dry and somewhat tart finish. Signature hints of French oak and the complex yeast character place this all-natural beer among the best saisons, stock ales, and farmhouse styles of Michigan, France & Belgium.

When they ran out of beer they still didn't want to go outside so they decided it would be better if they just started brewing their beer in the sauna.

Sahati,3253,Farmhouse Ale - Sahti,76,The Ale Apothecary,"Notes:SAHATI is our interpretation of traditional Finnish sahti. Starting with a 200-year old Engelmann spruce tree felled on brewery property, we created our own kuurna (an ancient Scandinavian lauter tun) to separate the wort from the grain during brewing. The bottom of the kuurna is layered with spruce branches; the needles act as a natural filter and impart resinous oils into the wort. The hollowed-out trunk of the tree also contributes spruce essence and structure from the raw wood. The beer is made of barley & rye malts along with a sparing addition of Goschie Farms Cascade hops and is brewed just a few times per year.  SAHATI is in many ways the very definition of The Ale Apothecary, where complex flavors arrive from the very methods used for production…the result is the process impacts the flavor profile at least as much as the ingredients themselves.

Surely therefore, our Saison Dupont is considered as “the classic” among the Belgian season beers!Coppery blond, the finest aromas and a strong bitterness transform this beer into a thirst-quenchener with no equal, just the way it was created.

Cellar Door,1875,Farmhouse Ale - Saison,45,Stillwater Artisanal Ales,"Notes:Over the ages the term ’cellar door’ has numerously been referred to as the most beautiful term in the English language. Upon setting out to create the first summer addition to the Stateside line up of ales; the feeling that almost instantly came to me was that of beauty & cleansing. Many summer offerings tend to lack the complexity of their bigger, colder season counterparts; so my goal was to craft an ale of extreme balance with a delicate complexity that allows for contemplation while also providing quaffable refreshment. Starting with a base of German wheat & pale malts this crisp slightly hazy foundation was then accented with a blend of Sterling & Citra hops providing a intricate blend of herbal grass & tangerine citrus flavors and aroma. To pull this all together and to complete the ’cleansing’ aspect of my vision I gently finished the ale off with a touch of white sage, lending a mild earthy spice character to the blend. Of course let’s not forget our house saison yeast that brought all the elements together leaving a dry yet intricate finish.	",6.6,4.04,20,38,38,37,4,31,47,76,0,80,115,20,42

With flavors of fresh berries and rye, Soft Parade finishes dry and eminently drinkable.Soft Parade was originally developed because Joe Short wanted to create a beer that incorporated a medley of berries, had a great color, and appealed to wine drinkers. The name Soft Parade stemmed from two moments in Joe Short’s life. First, because Joe worked as a brewer at the Traverse Brewing Company and The Doors album, The Soft Parade, played every day at the end of the brew shift. The second moment occurred when Joe was driving by himself, flipping through CD’s in his car, and came across The Soft Parade album again. At the time, The Soft Parade beer had not been named and it dawned on Joe that the medley of fruit infusing into the golden beer reminded him of a soft parade. That day the beer was named!

The vessel, made of birch bark, was found in the tomb of a leather‐clad woman Dr. Pat says was probably an upper-class dancer or priestess. The analysis pointed to the ingredients used in this unique brew: wheat, lingonberries, cranberries, myrica gale, yarrow, honey and birch syrup.The base of Kvasir is a toasty red winter wheat, and the bog-grown berries deliver a pungent tartness. While a handful of hops is used, the earthy, bitter counterpunch to the sweet honey and birch syrup comes from the herbs.	",10,3.76,0,0,11,34,30,21,155,75,1,97,54,2,53

Molecular archaeologist Dr. Patrick McGovern of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology calls on Dogfish Head to re-create another ancient beverage, and Chateau Jiahu is born.In keeping with historic evidence, Dogfish brewers use brown rice syrup, orange blossom honey, muscat grape, barley malt and hawthorn berry.

Go To IPA,1289,IPA - American,32,Stone Brewing,"Notes:A vibrant hop-bursted session IPAFirst Release: March 2014Since Day One, we've been abundantly forthright and fully transparent about our lust for hops. It's led us to craft many an IPA, most of them imperial—some intense for their time and all timeless in their intensity. For Stone Go To IPA, we embrace our hop obsession in a new way, funneling an abundance of lupulin-borne bitterness into a ""session"" IPA that delivers all the fruity, piney character of a much bigger IPA. To accomplish this, we employ ""hop bursting,"" a new technique wherein an irrational amount of hops is added during the final phase of the brewing process to coax out extreme flavors and aromas while also imparting a burst of desirably pleasant bitterness. The result is an alpha-acid-rich beer that fans can enjoy more of without missing out on the assertive hop character you, like us, crave. So, sit back and go two with your new everyday go-to IPA and bask along with us in the glory of the almighty hop.	",4.8,3.97,50,70,24,32,13,73,24,55,1,74,89,3,22

A natural process called ""bunging"" creates gentle carbonation, and the practice of dry hopping (adding fresh hops to the brew during aging), revived by Anchor, creates its unique aroma.Liberty Ale® was first brewed to celebrate the bicentennial of Paul Revere’s historic ride. As the first modern American IPA brewed after prohibition and the first modern American single-hop ale and dry-hopped ale, Anchor’s Liberty Ale® is the original craft brewed ale and the historic beer that started a revolution.

Tree Bucket Double IPA,1334,IPA - Belgian,33,Brewery Vivant,"Notes:Big, bold, and balanced, this double IPA is unlike most. We take an artistic Belgian approach to our beer. Our brewers sling some serious Citra hops into the kettle as you might expect, but we overlay that excessive hoppiness with Belgian candi sugar to add dimension to this beer. The result is a siege of hop flavor without the bitterness. Tree Bucket catapults out of the brewery once a year. Hoppy beers are not for cellaring. Find it, drink it, enjoy it now.

This version of Hop God is a fascinating, big, bold Belgian-style Tripel hopped in very high amounts to concentrate citrus, grapefruit and floral aromatics in the nose. The addition of Chardonnay barrel aging adds further dimension and oak tannins to an already wonderfully complex Ale – bringing to mind tropical fruits and peach.

Hop Trapp,1339,IPA - Belgian,33,Lakewood Brewing Company,"Notes:We're no monks, but our Belgian-style IPA gives a tip of the hat to our divine brethren. Brewed with rich malt, noble hops, Trappist yeast and a kick of coriander, this is one complex beer. Rather than make a beer that's more of a dare to drink than a pleasure, balance was the priority here. We wanted a beer for ""hop heads"" and novices alike. Hop Trapp pours with a refined bitter backbone, floral hoppy notes and a decidedly Belgian finish. This brew is worthy of some serious contemplation.	",6.4,3.67,50,80,20,39,13,85,28,51,0,44,123,15,35

Rouge,1415,IPA - Brut,35,Rogue Ales,"Notes:We don't joke about beer. So while many thought it was an April Fool's joke when we announced Rouge, a Brut IPA blended with Pinot Noir juice and dedicated to typos, we knew it was real and it was spectacular. The label is an anagram of our name: Rogue. And it's been the most common misspelling of our brand since day one.We can't count the times we've received phone calls for a ""Rouge Alés"" and we relish the opportunity to recount that one time our brewer's yeast was accidentally delivered to the gentleman's lounge, Club Rouge in Portland instead of Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery. Heck, we've even been guilty of misspelling our own name once or twice. It's such a common gaffe, we've even given it a term: ""getting rouged.""After 30 years of ""getting Rouged,"" we felt it was time to embrace our rougey roots and brew something delicious in honor of it.Rogue Innovation Brewer Michael King started with a brut IPA, a dry but aromatic example of the IPA style, combining 2-Row Malt, Corn Flakes and Rolled Oats. For hops, he selected Mosaic, Chinook, El Dorado, Strata, Rogue Farms Alluvial. He of course used our proprietary Pacman Yeast and Newport's own Free Range Coastal Water. And for a real Rogue (Rouge?) twist on it all, he blended it with Oregon Pinot Noir juice.The result is a crisp and semi-dry brut IPA co-fermented with Oregon Pinot Noir juice for a unique flavor and an added rouge hue. The finish is hoppy and delicious.	",7.5,3.79,20,40,19,10,9,27,44,26,0,47,29,1,7

IPA,1452,IPA - English,36,Harpoon Brewery & Beer Hall,"Notes:We started brewing this beer as a summer seasonal in 1993.

Dry-hopped with Cascade hops, it has a floral hop aroma and a finish that is bitter (it is an IPA after all!) without being harsh or astringent. Combined with a malty sweetness and the fruity esters of our proprietary yeast, those hops create a beer that is wonderfully hoppy but clean and refreshing enough to enjoy a few of - and we hope you do.42 IBU	",5.9,3.64,35,60,17,31,13,74,35,31,0,39,110,8,61

East India Pale Ale,1454,IPA - English,36,Brooklyn Brewery,"Notes:Plenty of IPAs will promise you the moon and the stars, looking to seduce you with words of smashing bitterness and hops everlasting.

East IPA is a clean, drinkable IPA that's packed with flavor and offers a bold balance, not a smack in the head. American hops soar in the bright piney aroma, while East Kent Goldings hops bring the taste of stone fruits and firm bitterness from IPA's ancestral British home. Give our East IPA a try with some rich crab cakes or salmon, strike up a conversation with farmhouse cheddars, and find harmony alongside spicy dishes. East IPA's blend of tradition and exuberance sets the standard for hop-driven deliciousness.	",6.9,3.65,35,60,20,33,10,73,28,35,2,36,92,8,53

Lagunitas Sucks,1505,IPA - Imperial,37,Lagunitas Brewing Company,"Notes:This sad holiday season we didn’t have the brewing capacity to make our favorite seasonal brew, the widely feared BrownShugga’ Ale. You see we had a couple of really good years (thank you very much) and so heading into this season while we are awaiting the January delivery of a new brewhouse we are jammin’ along brewing 80 barrels of IPA and PILS and such every 3 hours. A couple of months back we realized that since we can only brew a mere 60 barrels of Shugga’ every 5 hours, that we were seriously screwed. For every case of Shugga’ brewed, we’d short 3 cases of our favorite daily beers. It’s a drag. This year, we brewed something that we think is also cool and brews more like our daily brews. The new brewhouse will help insure this kind of failure never happens again. It’s a mess that we can not brew our BrownShugga’ this year and we suck for not doing it. There is nothing cool about screwing this up this badly and we know it. Maybe we can sue our own sorry selves. There is no joy in our hearts this holiday and the best we can hope for is a quick and merciful end. F*@& us. This totally blows. Whatever.

He was referring to the complex super-critical-CO2 hop extraction equipment set up on the table in the lab across from the brewhouse. Hop extracts are for the BIG brewers, he thought - suitable only for crummy sub-standard and barely-passable industrial lagers, not the subtle and elegant craft beer made here. But wrong he was. The New Brewer does not eschew any possible inputs. In this case the mountain of extracts will replace the mountain of hop vegetative material in the kettle thus creating cleaner hop flavors and preventing the otherwise spinach-like mess of a kettle full of super-hopped wort from clogging up a pump or worse. The sensuous honey-like amber ooze was administered intravenously to the wort kettle and the sacrament was complete. Another kettle of Hop Stoopid is once again raised up and fermented on high.

With this beer, our brewers thought it was so good that we decided to serve it straight from the tanks - unfiltered, unprocessed, and raw - to let all the fruit-forward hop flavors shine. The result is a hazy beer with modest bitterness and intense hop character.

King Julius,1578,IPA - New England,38,Tree House Brewing Company,"Notes:The holiday season has a way of stirring up nostalgia. In late 2012, we brewed King Julius on our original Brew Magic brewing system - a whole ten gallons of it! Despite the size of the batch, the memory of it is enormous in our hearts. The thought of it brings us back to our cozy Brimfield barn, with the wood stove cranking, the record player spinning, Santa Dean mulling about, and Lauren and Kim filling growlers out of a modified chest freezer in a small nook under a wooden staircase. As we continue to move forward in our journey it felt like the perfect time to pay homage to our beginnings. King Julius is our endeavor to marry our past with what we aspire to be in the future. King Julius is an American Double IPA brewed to be an exceptionally flavorful, juicy, and hop saturated beer while never tiring the palate. It’s vivid citrus aromas give way to flavors of orange creamsicle, mango smoothie, and a bounty of fresh tropical fruit. We find it to be supremely soft in the midst of an onslaught of flavor. . .

M-43,1582,IPA - New England,38,Old Nation Brewing Co.,"Notes:The First release in Old Nation's ""New Orthodox"" IPA series, M-43 is designed to accentuate the deep and complex character from the combination of Calypso, Simcoe, Citra and Amarillo hops. Citrus and Tropical notes of Pineapple, Mango and Grapefruit come through in the huge, yet surprisingly delicate aroma. The flavor backs these aromas with a soft, pillowy mouthfeel. Hop bitterness is not particularly intense, which leads to a very drinkable, New England IPA even non-IPA fans love. The Haze is not from yeast, but rather from an interplay of lipids from the malted oat and oils and acids which naturally occur in the hand selected Dry hops. This beer is a perfect interplay between top grade malt and hops, MI water and brewing technique which cannot be faked.Hops aren't cheap, but M-43 is worth every penny!65 IBU	",6.8,4.41,50,70,26,55,16,73,109,93,0,170,82,2,31

Juice Machine,1585,IPA - New England,38,Tree House Brewing Company,"Notes:Juice Machine was originally devised and brewed to support our very first trip to Extreme Beer Festival in 2014. We’ve revived and tweaked the original recipe on a 30 BBL scale and brought new life and experience into the idea of an obscenely hop saturated yet juicy and delicate Double IPA. It is essentially a marriage of the King Julius malt bill with a hopping intensity schedule similar to that of Very Green. The use of Magnum, Columbus, Amarillo, Citra, and Galaxy creates perhaps our most complex drink with unapologetic flavors of tangerine, mango, lime, papaya, and grapefruit with waves of dankness.

Ephraim,1586,IPA - New England,38,Hill Farmstead Brewery,"Notes:Ephraim (1823-1913) was our great-great grandfather; Hill Farmstead Brewery resides several hundred feet downhill from the land that he and his father settled. In his honor, this Imperial India Pale Ale is dutifully crafted from American malted barley, buckets of American hops, our ale yeast and water from our well. It is unfiltered, naturally carbonated, and double dry hopped.

Doubleganger,1587,IPA - New England,38,Tree House Brewing Company,"Notes:This beer was conceived with the intent to push the concept of Doppelganger to the limit of flavor and intensity. Both the kettle hopping rates and dry hopping rates were increased while keeping the base beer the same. The result is intense, but also surprising in its balance and softness. The mouthfeel is viscous and coating with flavors of overripe mango, dank citrus, and tropical fruit balanced by a sharp but pleasant finish. A treat to warm you up as a true New England winter takes hold!	",8.2,4.64,50,70,17,62,15,79,90,94,0,201,92,13,28

In Perpetuity,1590,IPA - New England,38,Tree House Brewing Company,"Notes:In 2014, I brewed an American Pale Ale - Beneficiaries of Chance - in celebration of marrying the love of my life, Lauren (aka Tree House L-Dog). On the eve of our first anniversary, I brewed another beer for Lauren, In Perpetuity. It hopes to celebrate foreverness - in love, passion, and regardless of circumstance - the notion that what is good and beloved will last forever. In Perpetuity is brewed with a simple malt bill and two of my favorite hops - Citra, and Nelson. It pours a hazy bright orange in the glass and mixes notes of tropical fruit with a strong citrus backbone. Soft, and eminently drinkable. I hope you enjoy it.

Very Hazy conveys all the beautiful flavors of Haze, but with even greater depth and potency. Pungent grapefruit notes greet your palate while an underlying current of soft tropical fruit dances in the background.

The impression of tropical fruit also takes the lead in the flavor which is layered further by white wine, pine resin and grapefruit zest.

It is brewed with lightly roasted malt and 100% German Noble Hops: Perle for bitterness and Hallertau Traditional for flavor and aroma.In 1918, the term Kölsch was used to describe the ale brewed in Köln, a city on the Rhine River in western Germany. The style began to rise in popularity in the 1960s and now, many American craft brewers brew variations of the style, labeling it a golden ale. Our Kölsch is unique to the Schlafly brewery because Ulrike, a native of Köln and wife of brewery co-founder Tom Schlafly, connected Schlafly Beer with the Gaffel Brewery of Köln.

Lager,702,Lager - American Amber / Red,19,Brooklyn Brewery,"Notes:In the late 1800’s Brooklyn was one of the largest brewing centers in the country, home to more than 45 breweries.

The aromatic qualities of the beer are enhanced by “dry-hopping”, the centuries-old practice of steeping the beer with fresh hops as it undergoes a long, cold maturation.

Dry-hopping is largely a British technique, which we’ve used in a Viennese-style beer to create an American original.	",5.2,3.74,18,30,20,27,4,65,34,19,0,23,86,3,72

Nomad,783,Lager - European Dark,20,Tree House Brewing Company,"Notes:Nomad is a czech-style dark lager, or tmavé pivo, constructed with deliberate attention to detail, tradition, and patience.It is brewed with authentic floor malted bohemian pilsner malt, german dark malts, and carefully selected noble hops. A laborious mashing and conditioning process yields a complex texture and malt profile.Nomad pours a nearly pitch black in the glass. Through extended, natural conditioning, not a hint of haze remains. An aggressive pour yields a thick and billowing head that clings to the side of the glass as you work your way through the pour. It is the most appealing looking beer we have made in recent memory. We taste mild chocolate, brown bread, hay, and earthy noble hops. It goes down remarkably easy while leaving a pleasant and lingering impression on your palate. The mark of a great beer is the ease in which it drinks in conjunction with potent, appealing, and incisive flavors. To that end, we are extraordinarily proud to offer Nomad to you for your enjoyment. I’m not sure if there is another beer we will collectively drink more of this autumn at Tree House.

Summer Lager,2520,Lager - Helles,59,The Schlafly Tap Room,"Notes:Our Helles-Style Summer Lager is a bright, golden beer, perfect for summertime. The malts we use impart a wonderful, fresh grain character, reminiscent of European lagers. The German Noble hop, Mittelfrüh, lends a mild lemony, spicy flavor.The German word “Helles” translates as “light” and “Lager” means “to store”. This beer style emerged in Germany through the Spaten Brewery’s marriage of British, Bohemian and German brewing techniques. This style is an integral part of brewing history and a predecessor of the straw-colored, light-bodied beers which are the most widely consumed beers in the world today. The lager yeast ferments the beer more slowly and at lower temperatures; it is then stored for maturation. This results in a beer which is more smooth and drinkable. Today, many American craft brewers offer this style as a maltier and hoppier alternative to American light lagers.17 IBU	",4.5,3.53,18,25,31,35,7,44,27,36,3,34,62,17,86

Nelson IPL,2580,Lager - India Pale Lager (IPL),60,Saint Archer Brewing Co.,"Notes:There are a few hops out there that brewers everywhere are constantly in pursuit of, and Nelson Sauvin is one of of them. We wanted to brew something that would convey our excitement about this hop, and out of that desire, our Nelson IPL was born. By using a lighter malt base, a blend of pilsner and 2-row, and a squeaky clean German Lager yeast, this allows Nelson to show off, and rightfully so. Exploding with white wine fruitiness and gooseberry, we recruited the assistance of Wakatu and Dr. Rudi to balance the hop profile. This beer is a spotlight on New Zealand and we hope you grow just as fond of the Southern Hemisphere as we have.	",6.8,4.08,30,70,37,20,10,88,66,45,1,99,107,11,30

We doubled down on the dry hop and incorporated New Zealand Motueka and German Mandarina Bavaria hops. For good measure we hit it with some Citra. We knew you wouldn’t mind. Soft and citrus-saturated hazy lager that’s an absolute crusher.Throwing an absurd amount of American hops at a classic lager seemed only natural for us. Shh, don’t tell the Germans.

Colorado Native IPL,2589,Lager - India Pale Lager (IPL),60,AC Golden Brewing Company,"Notes:India Pale Lager brewed with 100% Colorado ingredients.We don’t believe the world needs another IPA. We do, however believe there is room for a beer that is similar to an IPA, but is one that allows the hop characters to shine through as only a lager can do... ""An IPA done better"", if you will. To get this clean, crisp character, we brewed an ""IPA style"" beer, using lager yeast. The lager yeast is superior, in this case, because it doesn’t create all of the fruity esters and fusel alcohols that ale yeast create... so it allows the delicate hop oils to shine through in the beer. Our IPL takes longer to brew and is more expensive to make than an IPA, but once you try this IPL, we think you’ll agree........ It’s worth the extra time and expense.

Asahi Super Dry,3551,Lager - Japanese Rice,82,Asahi Breweries Ltd,"Notes:Asahi Super Dry was a direct result of extensive market research which indicated a consumer preference for a more palatable beer with less maltiness, relatively high alcohol content and a light aftertaste, that paired well with the changing Japanese diet. With this insight Asahi used its brewing knowledge to develop a beer with a crisp bite, refreshing taste and clear finish to satisfied this requirement. Code named project FX, Asahi engineered a highly attenuated, highly carbonated pilsner. The later renamed product, Super Dry began sales on March 17th 1987 and gave birth to the dry beer category. The market success spawned similar competitor products and initiated what was known as the “Dry Wars” in Japan and a brief marketing fad for dry beers internationally. However Asahi has stood the test of time and now years later Super Dry continues it legacy as the world’s premier dry beer. Special Yeast - Asahi # 318 is the proprietary ingredient used to give Super Dry its “dryness”. This special strand of yeast produces high attenuation during fermentation in conjunction with the choice grains.Finest Ingredients – Asahi uses select grains and hops sourced worldwide based on strict criteria to maintain flavor consistency and promote sustainability. Barely with high starch content and both noble style bitter and fine aroma hops are key contributors to Super Dry’s smooth taste.

Pleasantly tart and lightly carbonated, it is a beer that goes just as well with a good meal as it does with a relaxing evening after work. Did somebody say, “cult beer”? Yeah, why not. That’s fine with us. Sure, you could always say “one” U. But experience has taught us that that’s rarely the case.

A smooth toasty character paired with nutty flavours opens a distinctive finale, which unfolds impressions of butterscotch.	",5.2,3.82,20,40,23,46,6,30,63,34,0,20,53,9,110

Zeppelin Bier,2618,Lager - Kellerbier / Zwickelbier,61,Brauerei Max Leibinger GmbH,"Notes:Our Zeppelin Beer is a so-called ""Kellerbier"". The name ""Kellerbier"" has historical roots, dating back to the time when beer was still served directly from the cellar. It is an unfiltered, naturally cloudy beer with a low carbon dioxide content, and it contains all of the natural sediment. As a result, Kellerbier is rich in valuable nutrients such as yeast, protein, minerals and vitamins.Following the old family tradition, Zeppelin beer is brewed in accordance with the German Purity Law of 1516. As with all of our beers, we use the world-famous Tettnanger aromatic hops, high-quality barley grown in upper Swabia and pure water from the uplands of the Alps. We give the dark amber Zeppelin beer seven weeks to quietly mature. The result is a fully flavoured, mildly malty Kellerbier of the highest quality and goodness with an alcohol content of 5.2 percent. It’s a beer which is almost unrivaled in taste, thanks to its extremely delicately spiced, original flavor.	",5.2,3.47,20,40,13,52,18,36,71,21,0,32,52,9,117

Dunkel is made from amber colored Munich malt. Germans approach dark beer from a different direction than their Belgian and British neighbors. Instead of using a small amount of high-color, dark-roasted or caramelized malt, Germans use a lot of low or medium color malt that avoids the acrid bitter roastiness or burnt sugar flavors found in stouts and porters. Dunkel is a medium -bodied beer with a slightly sweet, toasted bread crust malt flavor and smooth finish accentuated with just enough noble bitterness to balance the malt.18 IBU	",5,3.84,15,25,14,32,3,28,41,4,0,2,25,6,84

Over the summer months, beers were stored, or lagered, in caves and stone cellars. The evolution of Oktoberfest came from the last brews of the year, in March (or Märzen), as these beers would be ready to drink for the Bavarian celebration, “Oktoberfest”.25 IBU	",5.5,3.62,18,25,25,39,4,26,57,20,0,14,42,14,94

Aecht Schlenkerla Kräusen,928,Lager - Rauchbier,23,Brauerei Heller-Trum / Schlenkerla,"Notes:Also known as Helles Märzen Kräusen Blend.In the world of German brewing, Kräusen refers to the intense proliferation of bubbles and foam formed during fermentation of a young or “green” beer. And Aufkräusen (literally to kräusen it up), refers to a historic brewing technique in which some green beer is added to a fully-matured lager. This is a very old and very typically German tradition, and today even English-speaking brewers refer to this technique as krausening. Krausening brings the vibrant freshness of young beer to the more refined, austere flavors of a fully-matured lager.Aecht Schlenkerla Kräusen starts out as normal Helles Schlenkerla Lager and matures for months in the old rock cellars underneath the brewery. Just before filling it is blended using the before mentioned ""Kräusen"" technique with classic Märzen Rauchbier. The result is an unfiltered, bottom fermented and amber color Märzen Lager hybrid with a vibrant and slightly smoky flavor.IBU: 30	",4.55,4.06,20,30,29,56,12,22,23,13,1,6,28,93,67

What to one palate is a hint of bacon or a whiff of BBQ to another is ashtray or Band-Aids. How can Carton ignore playing this game? Where can smoldering aromatics go off the beaten craft? In Peach Swisher we have reassembled the deconstructed aspects of a flavored blunt. Rich, dark malts rendered smoky by the addition of oak smoked pale wheat touched with peach and a heavy plug of the hops that smell like their cousins. Drink Peach Swisher and hand me down a 50-pack.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oMIuGs9wWY&t=3s ",6,3.96,20,30,4,8,0,8,4,2,0,21,7,15,11

5 O'Clock Shadow,989,Lager - Schwarzbier,24,Grand Teton Brewing Co.,"Notes:5 O’Clock Shadow Double Black Lager is brewed in the German Schwarzbier (black beer) tradition. Schwarzbier is to lager what stout or porter is to ale. Like those dark British beers, Schwarzbier has long been considered nourishing and even curative. German doctors often recommend Schwarzbier for nursing mothers. Our Brewmaster, born in Munich, was the beneficiary of just such advice.We have taken the traditional Schwarzbier, intended to be a “session beer” with typically moderate alcohol, and almost doubled its strength to 7.6% alcohol by volume. We brewed our version with a fine balance of crystal and roasted malts and spiced it with noble hops. We fermented 5 O’Clock Shadow at cold temperatures with a select German lager yeast and cold-conditioned it for over four months to create a velvety smooth, easy drinking springtime brew.This German lager pours a deep brown, almost black color with ruby highlights.

Translated from German, Schwarzbier means black beer.﻿Schwarzbier originated in the 16th Century in southeastern Germany where it is still brewed today. The style enjoyed a heyday in St. Louis in the late 1800s, but large scale production of dark lagers failed to resurface after Prohibition. In 2007, the beer community of St. Louis honored St. Louis Dark Lager as the official beer of the inaugural St. Louis Brewers Heritage Festival, an annual tasting event that celebrates the many breweries thriving in St. Louis today.﻿45 IBU	",5,3.64,20,30,25,63,13,53,63,14,0,7,42,10,125

Faro,5151,Lambic - Faro,118,Brouwerij Lindemans,"Notes:ABV varies slightlyLambic is one of the world's oldest beers. According to some, it is also the best, even if its characteristic acidity does not please all palates. To offset this acidity, some decided to add sugar to it. Thus faro was born. Adding sugar syrup to lambic was a revelation at the time of Bruegel. (Some even argue that without faro, Bruegel would have been deprived of inspiration and would have remained an ordinary amateur painter whose canvases couldn't even have been sold at a flea market.) Until the 19th century, faro was very prevalent in the Brussels region. Folklore there was frequently associated with it, and the divine liquid flowed like water. Then faro fell into oblivion. It was not until 1978 that our family brought it back to centre stage. Or centre Senne, as you prefer.

At that time (1986), ""Raspberry-Lambic"" already was synonymous with a sweet, artificially flavoured beer. This is why we decided to distinguish our beer from the other raspberry beers. Raymond proposed to call it a rosé, dedicated not to Bacchus but to Gambrinus.The process to make this beer is identical to the one to make Kriek. When young, the Rosé de Gambrinus will still present its full fruity taste. Later on, the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit taste.

Our meeting with American importer Charles Finkel in the 1970s revolutionized the fruit beer segment. Charles convinced us to export our old kriek to the United States by boat. What we had not thought of is that the movement of the waves would reactivate the fermentation process and cause the corks to pop during the trip. It was like something out of The Adventures of Tintin. To prevent that from happening, we therefore developed an alternative production method for our kriek. We use fresh, not from concentrate, unsweetened cherry filtrate which we blend with lambic that is at least one year old before fermenting & macerating for up to 3 days and pasteurizing the whole batch. So the corks don't pop. Due to the use of filtrate and pasteurization, this kriek is sweeter and fruitier than Old Kriek Cuvée René, which undergoes a second fermentation process in the bottle. Thanks to its innovative flavour, it was a resounding success both here in Belgium as well as around the world. Nowadays, it is undoubtedly the reference kriek for consumers.18 IBU	",3.5,3.89,15,21,22,28,10,3,87,89,0,102,7,9,13
Oude Kriek,5176,Lambic - Fruit,119,Brouwerij 3 Fonteinen,"Notes:3 Fonteinen Oude Kriek is the result of macerating hand-picked whole sour cherries on young lambic for at least four months, in a proportion of one kilogram of fruit per litre of lambic. The kriek lambic is then blended again with more young lambic to obtain a minimum intensity of 35% fruit, and is bottled immediately afterwards. These bottles are then stored in our cellars for at least five months so that the kriek lambic can develop into a beautiful, traditional, and refined Oude Kriek. With a pleasant tartness and organic notes of almond and cinnamon as it warms in the glass, 3 Fonteinen Oude Kriek, will age perfectly but may lose some of the vibrant red colours and forest fruit aromas.

Very refreshing, this beverage is a perfect thirst-quencher which, thanks to its fizzy and tangy flavour, is ideal as an aperitif.In order to produce the Oude Kriek Cuvée René, the cherries ferment in lambic that is at least six months old in huge 10,000-litre oak barrels called foudres. After six months, this traditional kriek is bottled in corked 75 cl bottles.

This geuze has fermented in the bottle and will continue to develop its tastes and aromas over its long life when properly cellared. Traditional Lambic is living, cultural heritage rooted in the Zenne valley! Taste, savour, enjoy, and experience this unfiltered, unpasteurised, and unadulterated beer with friends new and old!

Gueuze,5237,Lambic - Gueuze,120,Brouwerij Lindemans,"Notes:From the brewery:There are several stories to explain the origin of the term 'gueuze'. This name dates back to the Rue de Gueuze in Brussels where, for the first time, a producer offered his delicious lambic in champagne bottles. Word about the 'lambick on Rue de Gueuze' quickly got around. According to other sources, gueuze has its roots in 'gazeux' - the French word for carbonated - since traditional gueuze is a carbonated blend of different lambics.After the Second World War, some lambic brewers devised a new production method. They filtered the beer, added sugar, saturated it (with carbon dioxide) and pasteurised it. This new gueuze, closed with a bottle cap and available in 25 cl bottles, was called capped gueuze. Developed according to this production method, Gueuze Lindemans is a slightly sweeter version of Old Gueuze Cuvée René.	",5,3.64,0,10,31,32,7,8,131,183,0,97,24,3,24

Iris,5265,Lambic - Traditional,121,Brasserie Cantillon,"Notes:It is a completely original beer which, contrary to the other products of the Brewery, is not brewed with 35% of wheat. The Iris, which is only made with malt of the pale ale type (giving a more amber colour to the beer) conserves the typical flavour of the spontaneous fermentation, the complex aromas and the vinous taste.The hopping is different too. Lambic is made with 100% dried hops, for the Iris we use 50% of dried hops and 50% of fresh hops. The latter cause a superb acidity, the former, due to their tannins, enable to conserve the beer while preserving all its qualities. After two years in the barrel, the Iris undergoes a second fresh hopping two weeks before the bottling. A linen bag, filled with hops, is soaked in the beer for two weeks. This technique, called ""cold hopping"", gives the beer a more intense savour and makes the smell and the taste more bitter.Iris is brewed only once every season and all the beers come from the same brewing. This is why the beer is dated. The second fermentation is obtained by adding liquor. Although it is a spontaneous fermentation beer, the Iris is very different from the Lambic. The amber colour and the bitter and slightly caramelized taste make it a complex beer.	",6.5,4.37,0,10,69,34,16,90,59,191,4,123,100,17,56

After a mechanical breakdown, 3 Fonteinen Brewery of Beersel (possibly the best Lambic blender in the world) had economic damage in the summer of 2009. The news caused such a stir in the International beer movement that I called Armand to know how things were. As he needed to sell his Lambic, I immediately got inspired to blend our New Morning with his beer. We selected three 18 month old Lambic barrels that we siphoned in a small tank on our truck. The journey back was long and hard, myself and Manuel took turns driving through Belgium, France and Italy only stopping for gas. After days hand bottling and months of maturation, the outcome has gone over and beyond our expectations and we can say with pride that it was worth it! 14°	",6.2,4.14,0,10,41,36,10,16,41,163,1,69,43,24,10

This unique, beautiful brew is often imitated but never matched and is sold literally all over the world. With countless awards to its credit, it is something of which every Briton can be very proud and is the epitome of the greatest of British brewing tradition.In the early years of the modern brewing era, about two hundred years ago, many brewers produced a dark, strong ‘stock’ beer in the winter months, to provide a base amount of fermented beer to add to beers brewed in the rather more volatile months of the summer.Old Peculier probably owes its origins to this. The name pays tribute to the unique ecclesiastical status of Masham as a ‘Court of the Peculier’ and is also reference to the strong characteristic of the beer! For many years it was affectionately referred to as Yorkshire’s ‘Lunatic’s Broth’.	",5.6,3.98,30,65,10,36,22,40,88,32,2,61,38,9,97

Invasion,2030,Pale Ale - American,48,Cigar City Brewing,"Notes:The people of Tampa Bay have fallen prey to Pirate invasion every year for well over 100 years. After more than a century of failing to repel these seafaring raiders in their anachronistic wooden ships, despite access to modern sea, land and air arsenals that ostensibly should make short work of wind powered vessels equipped with naught but cast iron cannons and raging scurvy, it occurred to the folks of Cigar City Brewing that if you can’t beat them start saying Arrrr Matey! And so we have brewed Invasion Pale Ale. With tropical notes of mango and tangerine imparted by Simcoe and Mosaic hops, this crisp and sessionable Pale Ale is a perfect companion for long days of marauding, pillaging, and pirating.

CitruSinensis,2031,Pale Ale - American,48,Lagunitas Brewing Company,"Notes:We took some fresh Sanguinello blood oranges, juiced 'em, concentrated that juice (without heat) and threw it into a wheatier version of our New Dogtown Pale Ale. The end result? A refreshingly hopped pale-ish ale with a huge citrus burst!The man bent over his guitar, a shearsman of sorts. The day was green. They said, 'You have a blue guitar, you do not play things as they are.' The man replied, 'Things as they are / Are changed upon the blue guitar.' And they said then, 'But play, you must, a tune beyond us, yet ourselves, a tune upon the blue guitar of things exactly as they are.' He sighs, I cannot bring a world quite round, although I patch it as I can. I sing a hero's head, large eye and bearded bronze, but not a man, although I patch him as I can and reach through him almost to man. If to serenade almost to man is to miss, by that, things as they are, say it is the serenade of a man that plays a blue guitar..."" These, the words of the Conjurer-in-Chief; Wallace Stevens, describe in perfect detail the work of a brewer as he sits to write a new recipe. Perfection is the goal, to fill a desire for a perfect beer. Yet the instrument of his mind and that of the brewhouse and yeast are the fallible tools at hand. And so he patches it as he can. A little hop here, a little citrus there, a yeast to marry the two, the worty substrate of reality calling the key and time signature. The beer that comes will be the beer we drink, the beer whose story we will tell here. The brewer does what he can and imagines a world quite round. Conjurer-in-Chief Stevens concludes; ""Exceeding music must take the place of empty heaven and its hymns."" What does it all have to do with beer?	",7.9,4.08,25,50,30,32,22,60,69,109,0,159,71,6,43
Citra Hopped Live Pale Ale,2032,Pale Ale - American,48,Southern Tier Brewing Company,"Notes:Beer is made by creating a liquid rich with fermentable material. Yeast, a living organism, is added to the liquid. The yeast floats around the fermenter gobbling up soluble sugar & converting that energy into alcohol. It’s a volatile & active environment. During this time, the beer is literally alive.Citra Hopped Live is bright, refreshing & loud. We cranked this pale ale up to 11 by adding a generous amount of Citra hops. With that in mind, we wanted the label to reflect the feeling of live music.

We brewed a pilot batch with this hop exclusively and one with it blended with some of our other favorite Northwest varieties. In the end, we decided that the El Dorado had such a unique and interesting character on its own, so we decided to brew it as a “single hop” pale ale. The aroma and flavor offer intense candied orange and citrus zest. A touch of flaked oats provide a rounded, silky mouthfeel.

Orval Trappist Ale,2051,Pale Ale - Belgian,49,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,"Notes:Orval beer is a high fermentation beer. The ageing process adds a fruity note, which strikes a subtle balance between the beer’s full-bodied yet complex flavour and bitterness.The beer was first brewed in 1931 and owes its unparalleled taste to the quality of the water, the hops and the yeast used. The brewery has selected very aromatic and unique hop varieties, which hark back to the first brewmaster of Orval, who hailed from Bavaria. The beer’s aromas are very pronounced while maintaining the right level of bitterness thanks to the English method of dry hopping.The various stages of fermentation – combined fermentation with the original yeast and with wild yeast, followed by fermentation in the bottle – mean the beer must age for some time and requires numerous quality controls.

Unknown to many, some of the Trappist brewers also brew a milder ale for daily consumption within the walls of the monastery.

Pale Ale,2116,Pale Ale - English,50,The Schlafly Tap Room,"Notes:Our flagship Pale Ale is a smooth, balanced, copper-colored session beer with mildly spiced flavor and aroma from the East Kent Goldings hops. The bready, lightly caramel malt complements the hint of fruitiness contributed by the London Ale yeast, making it satisfying and authentic; the perfect flagship beer for Schlafly.Sixteenth century brewers created amber beers by using a form of coal called coke to roast their grains. Coke burns hotter and more steadily than wood without imparting the foul odors from coal. It allowed brewers to produce caramel malts that were paler alternatives to the common brown porters. At about the same time, Flemish migrants introduced hops to English beers and soon this ale became the chosen style of England from the mid-16th century until the end of the 20th century. Today, brewers outside England have adopted the Pale Ale and made it one of the leading styles of the American craft beer movement.25 IBU	",4.4,3.61,20,40,14,19,6,55,52,36,0,31,77,11,87

Pilsner,2812,Pilsner - German,65,Brooklyn Brewery,"Notes:Brooklyn Pilsner is a refreshing golden lager beer, brewed in the style favored by New York’s pre-prohibition brewers. In the 1840’s, the pilsner style emerged from central Europe to become the world’s most popular style of beer. Like its ancestors, Brooklyn Pilsner is traditionally brewed from the finest German two-row barley malts. German-grown Perle and Hallertauer hops provide a crisp, snappy bitterness and fresh, floral aroma. The flavor of the malt comes through in the finish. We ferment Brooklyn Pilsner at cool temperatures, and then give it a long, gentle maturation (lagering), which results in a beer of superior complexity and smoothness. We believe that you will find there to be none finer. Unlike mass-marketed so-called pilsners, Brooklyn Pilsner does not contain cheap fillers such as corn or rice, nor does it contain any preservatives or stabilizers. Brooklyn Pilsner is the real thing.	",5.1,3.67,25,40,35,29,7,54,13,8,8,9,72,2,49

Ship Wreck,3100,Porter - Imperial,71,Carton Brewing Company,"Notes:Aged 1 year in Brinley Rum barrels.Shipwreck PorterBarrel Aged PorterABV: 10% | IBU: 26 | SRM: 42When our friends and neighbors at Brinley shipped us ten of the barrels used to make their Brinley Gold Shipwreck Rum from their distillery on St. Kitts, we were given the opportunity to create a beer that would take advantage of wood rather than the other way around. We looked to coax complexity out of the marriage of a barrel's soul and a brew's potential, not just to bomb a huge beer with huge flavor. The rum that lives in these barrels for four years integrates its spice to the wood so well that it ends up reminiscent of a Bananas Foster. A sturdy brown honey porter seemed the best host to receive the ghosts from Shipwreck's old home. We started with a base of deep malts looking for notes of coffee and chocolate, then enhanced them with the floral bouquet of local wildflower honey and the preservative strength of 10% ABV while keeping the body sensible. This was put in the casks to meld with the vanilla, wood, and spice notes, toned down by the oxidative effect of a year in the cellar. Drink Shipwreck Porter because a barrel should be so much more than a depth charge.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMRNXQnMTAg&list=UUnN44_ILc3y0x6WbvjLR1Kg ",10,4.24,35,50,2,93,72,48,68,3,0,10,9,40,111

The Big Smoke,3161,Porter - Smoked,73,8 Wired Brewing Co.,"Notes:Now what is this? A smoked beer?? It really isn't as crazy as it sounds. 250 years ago virtually all beers were smoked (it's true, Google it!), but with the dawning of the industrial revolution most of the smoke lifted. However, in the German town of Bamberg the flame has quite literally been kept alive and to this day the town’s brewers produce world renowned beers brewed with their own special rauchmalz (beechwood smoked malt).We’ve taken our best porter recipe and added a good measure of that same Bamberg Rauchmalz. The smoke mingles beautifully with the rich, dark roasted chocolate flavours of the porter without being overpowering. Although it pairs extremely well with smoked seafood, barbeques, strong cheeses and hearty stews, its food friendliness isn’t limited to savouries; chocolate and caramel based deserts are great companions too! Trust us; it really isn't as crazy as it sounds.40 IBU	",6.2,3.88,20,40,19,104,18,60,89,25,0,28,37,118,133

Thus, when we brewed Smoked Porter to release in the winter of 2017, we also set some aside in bourbon barrels. Each individual barrel then received additions of several whole Madagascar vanilla beans to impart their rich and creamy flavors into the beer as it aged. Now, six months later, it is ready to drink.

In the 1990’s, American craft brewers reintroduced the style to the delight of pumpkin beer drinkers.16 IBU	",8,4.23,5,70,12,27,6,11,36,17,0,92,13,77,44

Its love at first sip as the full malt body, dominated by British crystal malt, brown sugar and pumpkin, slowly washes over your tongue. Bourbon barrel aging rounds out the flavors with notes of oak, vanilla, and bourbon. Pairs well with crisp autumn weather, crunchy fallen leaves, and the knowledge that your kids will be asleep soon so you can raid their Halloween candy bags.

Maple MistressSaucony Creek Brewing Company + Gastropub,3693,Pumpkin Beer,84,Saucony Creek Brewing Company + Gastropub,"Notes:In the autumn of 1720, Captain Jack Rachman and his pirate-mates were celebrating their victories in typical hard-drinking tradition. Suddenly a British Navy sloop surprised them. The drunken pirates hid below deck, leaving Captain Jack’s mistresses Anne Bonney and Mary Read to defend the ship. The women shared a reputation as “fierce hell cats,” but the British Navy eventually overtook the pirate ship. Captain Jack and the pirates were sentenced to hang. Anne visited her lover in his cell before his execution, and instead of loving words her scathing comments live on throughout history, “Had you fought like a man, you need not have been hang’d like a dog.” Their legacy inspired us to brew an equally ferocious Imperial Pumpkin Ale brewed with pirate rum spices. We added a touch of autumn flavor with roasted butternut squash and natural maple syrup.	",9.5,3.96,5,70,14,41,34,14,112,13,1,53,17,85,88

Of course, because this is a Rock and Roll inspired Box Set beer, we couldn’t just leave well enough alone.Upon sampling the base beer, it became apparent that the raisins used to brew the base beer were going to drive the flavor bus of this beer.

Three Philosophers - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4400,Quadrupel (Quad),100,Brewery Ommegang,"Notes:We have a new twist on an old favorite coming out in February. Our unique Three Philosophers Quardupel Ale is universally-known as the preferred elixir of life’s meditators, thinkers and theorizers. Now, thanks to Brewmaster Phil Leinhart and the 24 bourbon barrels he got his hands on, mullers of life’s mysteries can ponder all the more deeply. “We’ve experimented with barrel aging in the past and had great success,” said Brewmaster Phil Leinhart. “Three Philosophers is such a lovely, complex beer and it ages so beautifully that we thought it the perfect fit for pairing with bourbon barrels. The result is exactly what we hoped for: even more complex flavors and a slightly fuller body than the standard. We’re sure this’ll be a crowd pleaser.”Like the original, Bourbon Barrel-aged Three Philosophers pours a deep burgundy hue with a fluffy, off-white head. Patience through the aging process rewarded the brewers with flavors of caramel, raisin, dried fruit, molasses, and vanilla and aromas of oak, vanilla, and subtle hints of cherry. The body is ample but still finishes faintly dry with lingering hints of malt, bourbon, and cherry. The effects of barrel-aging, eliciting remnant alcohol from the cooperage during the aging process, escalated the ABV of the beer from 9.7% to a significant, yet sneakily subtle, 11.4% ABV.ABV varies by batch	",12.3,4.15,25,50,17,53,80,16,106,41,0,104,11,35,123

The beer was first brewed in September 2015 to support music and arts education programs in Pataskala, Ohio, where Stone co-founder Greg Koch grew up. People there loved it, so we added the beer to our seasonal lineup. The deep crimson hue is courtesy of a fairly new special German malt variety by BESTMALZ called Red X.

Five different malts, select hop varieties, and our own specially cultivated yeast create an ale which leads with hop flavors and a subtle impression of fruit (our yeast's contribution), followed by a palate pleasing malty finish. Our own special process uses the yeast to naturally carbonate the beer, and we leave it unfiltered. The result is a satisfying brew full of flavor with a remarkably clean and smooth finish.

The Craic,2228,Red Ale - Irish,52,Harpoon Brewery & Beer Hall,"Notes:Why should St. Patrick’s Day just be a “day” when you can make a whole season out of it?! Crack open The Craic and let the friendly banter, bursts of laughter, and toe-tapping music of the season get your eyes smiling.This hybrid ale combines two classic styles —IPA and Irish Red Ale—to create a unique and flavorful beer. Th­e malt combination commonly used in Irish Red Ales brings a toasted, malty flavor that balances the citrusy and fruity character of the hops.The Levels of Craic: Have you tried our new Irish Red IPA, The Craic? As we prepare for all things Irish for Harpoon St. Pat’s Fest on March 3rd and 4th, we thought it would only be right to give you a little bit more history about the phrase ‘the craic.’ Pronounced just like a drug, crack (crack is whack, btw!), it’s a term for news, gossip, fun, entertainment, and enjoyable conversation. You’ll often hear, “What’s the Craic” in Ireland which is like saying “What’s Happening?” But perhaps our favorite part of the word ‘craic’ is that there are actually 6 levels of craic you can reach (according to IrelandCentral. Check ‘em out: Level One: Good Craic – It’s an okay night out, but nothing to write home about (we don’t know why we mentioned this because honestly, St. Pat’s Fest could never be just at level one – but … the more you know). Level Two: Mighty Craic – It’s obviously a little bit better than good craic, but we still haven’t hit the amazing level. One or two of your friends may have done something a little bit crazy. Hopefully, you caught it on Snapchat.Level Three: Savage Craic – This is getting closer to how we describe St. Pat’s. A great time with your friends; beers flowing, great bands, food, and jokes. You got a number, you gave a number, you get the idea. Level Four: Deadly Craic –This is most likely just before you hear Shipping Up to Boston by the Dropkick Murphy’s (right?). It’s just a step about savage, but not quite the pinnacle moment. Level Five: The craic was ninety – Wait, what? We’ve read that this phrase comes from a famous song by The Dubliners (get your Irish jig on), but essentially it’s the best night ever. Which is what we hope you’ll leave St. Pat’s fest saying. Level Six: Minus Craic – When a night goes terribly wrong. As employee owners, we’ve seen several of our consumers (and friends, to be honest), hit this level. Don’t be that guy! So, now that you know – what level of craic are you looking for this St. Pat’s Fest?!	",6.9,3.8,20,30,11,35,5,63,58,27,0,33,84,6,70

Even in that arena, it has largely been eclipsed by corn and barley, the sources of bourbon and scotch. But when we procured some seasoned barrels from our friends at Templeton Rye, we asked ourselves, “Why not?” Why not brew a rich, tawny rye ale, then mellow it in the warmth of charred oak rye whiskey casks? Two kinds of malted rye provide spicy sweetness, giving way to notes of caramelized wood and the citrusy tang of Perle, Magnum, and Saphir hops before easing into a dry, lingering finish.47 IBU	",12,4.25,10,80,11,52,102,18,71,14,1,19,11,28,161

Rye adds a spicy note while Aromatic malt adds a more subtle flavor than C-60 but increases malt aroma.• We lowered the mash rest temperature a few degrees, giving the final beer less body and more drinkability.• We jacked up the dry hopping to four times the level of Finest Kind for big hop aroma.65 IBU	",6.8,3.94,10,80,16,54,11,54,42,55,0,62,74,39,119

As we all know (or should know) Chiquen refers to anything that is not chicken.Now that we have all that straight, we will talk about what is in this beer. Brewed with Maris Otter from the UK and rye malt and caramel rye from Germany, imparting a spicy, fruity and dry flavor. Then hopped with enough English Nugget and Kent Goldings just to balance and fermented with our house ale yeast. After fermentation we moved the entire batch into the AtG private dining room and into used Redemption Rye barrels from our good friends at Strong's Spirits. There it aged for 5 weeks until we felt it had picked up the right amount of residual bourbon character and oak flavors. We then transferred it to our serving tank, carbonated it and the end result is on tap now, a balanced drinkable and complex barrel aged beer.	",8.6,3.68,10,80,20,51,83,20,40,25,0,20,26,34,171

RPA (Rye Pale Ale),3740,Rye Beer,85,Cameron's Brewing Co.,"Notes:Cameron’s Rye Pale Ale ABV is one of our most popular seasonal beers. It was originally brewed for the 2011 Bar Volo IPA challenge, earning 2nd Place, by combining the best parts of American and British IPA styles, we achieved a robust and unique staple. This fusion is hazy orange-amber in colour, with a well-constructed white head. It begins with an up front citrus aroma followed by a complex malt body with a hint of peppery rye which releases earthy floral British hop flavour on the finish.It is made of a combination of seven different floral British and pungent American hops, some which are added in a dry hopping process. This involves adding hops directly to the fermented beer in the fermenter. The hops are well supported by a large malt bill of five character malts with a generous portion of rye which contributes to mouth feel and Cameron’s Rye Pale Ale’s own special character.

Improved Old Fashioned,3749,Rye Beer,85,Brooklyn Brewery,"Notes:Here at Brooklyn Brewery, we are, of course, beer people. But we are also “drinks people,” and many inspirations come to us out of the deep and wondrous world of cocktails. While surely invented earlier, the modern cocktail emerged in the 19th century. The original—the ur-cocktail, if you will—was the Old Fashioned. A deceptively simple drink consisting of whiskey, sugar, and bitters (stirred, not shaken), usually with a bit of citrus peel, a good Old Fashioned remains a thing of austere beauty. By the 1860s, some bartenders, Jerry Thomas (aka ""The Professor"") chief among them, became household names in America. A mixologist (believe it or not, the moniker is actually old) looking to make a name for himself would often make a change to an existing cocktail, perhaps adding absinthe, or curaçao, or a dash of maraschino liqueur. This new version would be rakishly referred to as “improved,” as the upstart barman fervently hoped to eclipse his predecessor.Well, we’ve gone this idea one better. We have “improved” the Old Fashioned by making it into a beer. Witness our strong rye beer, suffused with various spices and peels! Wonder at its long blissful rest in WhistlePig Rye Whiskey oak barrels! Marvel at its clever infusions of bitter gentian root and enticing botanicals! And then enjoy, as you are greeted by the silky spice of rye, the firm herbal bitterness, the brightness of citrus, and the sweet warmth of oak. Sit in your favorite chair, surround yourself with your favorite people, and imbibe this, our latest Brooklyn Quarterly Experiment. We can nearly guarantee that you shall feel that your day has, in fact, improved.Style: Barrel-aged rye ale with botanicals & bittersMalts: Glen Eagle Maris Otter, Canadian 2-row, Weyermann Rye, Fawcett Rye, Fawcett Crystal RyeAdditions: Demerara sugar, Belgian candi syrup, bitter orange peel, lemon peel, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, bitter gentian root, cloves, and aging in WhistlePig Rye whiskey barrelsHops: PerleYeast: Our House Ale YeastOriginal Gravity: 21° Plato	",12.8,4.14,10,80,11,75,93,73,100,79,0,106,87,138,146

Snarling Badger Berliner Weisse,5347,Sour - Berliner Weisse,122,Grand Teton Brewing Co.,"Notes:In Berliner Weisse we think we’ve found the perfect style for our summer Cellar Reserve. This north German wheat beer is traditionally brewed and released very fresh. It has a light body from the wheat and refreshingly tart acidity that make it a perfect summer thirst-quencher. Its lemony tartness is provided by a secondary fermentation with lactobacillus, the same microorganism that’s responsible for yogurt’s tang. That tartness increases and improves with age, so the people of Berlin are known to buy extra bottles to bury in their gardens for two years or more.As usual with our Cellar Reserves, we’ve taken a traditional style and added our own twist. In this case we’ve tripled the strength over the traditional beer, which should only increase its aging potential. For the primary fermentation we used a traditional Bavarian hefeweizen yeast that produces soft notes of banana and clove. We followed that with lactobacillus and six months in conditioning to create a complex fruity acidity that compliments the soft sweet malt tones and a unique ale that is both fulfilling and refreshing.15 IBU	",7.5,3.55,3,6,38,42,26,8,58,180,3,87,10,23,60

Elegant and rustic, and full of complex flavors, berries, spice, and a hint of nuttiness, this is a great beer to share with friends on a special occasion.Born of the fortuitous encounter between a strong stout and fermented apricots from the Valais, which never reached the distillers. Our Oud Bruin (Flemish for “Old Brown”) is a rather unorthodox take on the style. It nevertheless boasts the typical sweet and sour balance between a solid malty, toffee-like, chocolaty, roasted and fruity backbone. Into this the fermented apricots merge seamlessly, with their lactic sourness, leathery and horse blanket notes from wild yeasts and a discrete touch of apricot deep down. It finally evolves harmoniously into a slightly bitter finish. Altogether a pretty unique yet very drinkable beer.	",7.2,3.99,20,25,51,48,26,14,102,213,1,106,18,11,61

After the main fermentation and the second lagering the ""Vichtenaar"" undergoes a third fermentation in oak casks for several months. The oak casks are large vats with a capacity ranging between 5000 and 25000 liters. The ""Vichtenaar"" is a traditional and typical beer for West Flanders, in the Northwest of Belgium. The taste of the ""Vichtenaar"" can be described as slightly acidic and complex and this through the long fermentation in oak casks. The fresh taste of the ""Vichtenaar"" makes it a particularly thirst-quenching beer, especially during the summer months. The ""Vichtenaar"" is also one of the last old-Flemish red-brown beers which are matured in oak casks and is especially appreciated for its authenticity by the beer connoisseur. In 1958 “Brewery Verhaeghe” obtained for its beer ""Vichtenaar"" the first prize in the international contest for beers in Ghent.	",5.1,3.96,10,25,32,36,16,6,124,154,0,113,9,17,23

The fruit is sourced from the region around Sint-Truiden in Limburg (Belgium).Unlike the most famous fruit beers the basic beer of the ""real cherry beer"" is not a Lambic but a West-Flemish red-brown ale aged in oak wood. About mid-July at the picking, the Northern cherries are brought in at the brewery and laid in on the base beer.Because the taste of the cherry fruit varies from year to year and this according to the number of hours of sunshine or rain, the kriekenbier at its final composition is blended with cherry beer from the year before and two-year old cherry beer. This with the intention of becoming a more constant taste of the ""real cherry beer"" over the years.	",6.8,3.9,10,25,37,26,7,2,91,140,0,131,13,13,28

It starts with an acidic base that has made at least 2 years of mixed fermentations (conducted mainly by lactic, acetic bacteria and brettanomyces) which have at least 6 months macerated cherries and sour cherries, blend with a small part of chimera and some young beer; the blend is put in numbered bottles indicating the year of the cuvée, which refined further 12 months before selling.La Luna Rossa is like a kriek on the basis flemish red, has an extraordinary complexity associated with a wonderful elegance, for lovers of the genre is definitely one of those beers that you find it difficult to forget.- GiovanniIn the glass, to the nose and in the mouth …Born from the blend about different beers, some of them aged in barrels until 2 years with the addition morello and marasca cherries.

We begin by brewing a straightforward Kolsch with lots of wheat and Munich Malt, then we brew a salty Gose with black limes, coriander and our sea salt. We follow it all up with a citrusy-tart Berlinerweiss made with lime juice and lime peel. All three beers are then blended together in the fermentation tank to create this German hybrid.

Troublesome,5466,Sour - Gose,125,Off Color Brewing,"Notes:Most brewers spend a lot of time and effort keeping lactobacillus out of their breweries; it was the first thing we brought in (it still has to stay in the corner though).

We blend the two beers together with coriander and salt at the tail end of fermentation to create a mild, lemony tartness and a fuller sensation of mouthfeel. And yes, it's hard to make.10 IBU	",4.3,3.83,10,15,18,32,9,8,24,111,30,57,33,12,40

The twins would ultimately grow up to avenge their father and uncle and defeat the Dark Lords and ascend the heavens to become the moon and sun.

Old School Stout,3947,Stout - English,90,Tree Brewing,"Notes:When you call something ""old school"", it's usually because it's original or a classic. That is exactly why we've named this beer Old School Stout, because it's our interpretation of a classic dry stout.The word stout originally meant ""proud"" or ""brave"" but after the 14th century it took on the connotation of ""strong"". While our Old School Stout isn't exactly strong in alcohol (5.5% ABV), it is very much a rich full bodied Ale dominated by chocolate and roasted malt flavours and very well balanced. Dry stouts achieve a dry-roasted character through the use of roasted barley, just one of the six malts in our Old School Stout recipe. A subtle bitterness leads to a long creamy finish on this aphotic beauty.	",5.5,3.86,20,40,11,53,8,39,22,2,0,0,21,4,65

Guinness 200th Anniversary Export Stout,3964,Stout - Foreign / Export,91,Guinness Ltd.,"Notes:Guinness history changed forever in 1817. In that year Benjamin Guinness—Arthur’s son—brewed our first beer with a new roasted grain called black patent malt. His stout recipe laid the foundation for how we would brew for the next 200 years.The same year Benjamin brewed his lovely dark beer, we shipped the first barrels of Guinness to America. To this day, America’s favorite stouts are still brewed at St. James’s Gate. Based on the Guinness brewing logs of 1817, Guinness 200th Anniversary Export Stout seeks to bring to life the same dark ruby red color and complex flavor of Benjamin’s beer from 200 years ago.

Oatmeal Stout,4080,Stout - Oatmeal,93,The Schlafly Tap Room,"Notes:Our Oatmeal Stout is a classic British-style stout brewed with flaked oatmeal and roasted barley. Freshly-roasted coffee beans, cocoa and touches of raisin and dried fruit dominate the aroma of this super dark ale. The richness of the grain blend is balanced by the nutty character of the roasted malt, the creaminess from the oatmeal flakes and a dose of hops.Before the 19th century, all barley was malted over wood-fired kilns and the resulting dark roasted malt defined the browns, porters, and stouts of England. Near the end of the 19th century, brewers had introduced oats for their purported restorative and nourishing characteristics, producing beers such as oatmeal stout and milk stout. By the 1950’s, Oatmeal Stout had nearly trickled out of existence. Following the beer’s literary rebirth in the articles of English beer writer Michael Jackson in the 1970’s, British and American craft brewers are once again promoting the style.40 IBU	",5.7,3.68,20,40,7,70,9,47,54,18,0,27,17,7,129

Black Chocolate Stout,4104,Stout - Russian Imperial,94,Brooklyn Brewery,"Notes:This is the famous Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. In the 18th century, Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, ordered a stout to be sent to her from England. This beer was brewed strong and hoppy to survive the sea voyage, and it arrived in perfect condition. Soon ""Russian Imperial Stout"" became the toast of the Russian aristocracy. Brewed since 1994, our Black Chocolate Stout has itself become a modern classic, heralded the world over. It achieves its dark chocolate aroma and flavor through the artful blending of six malts and three distinct mashes. Properly kept, it will improve in the bottle for many years. This stout is the toast of the winter season in many countries, and there is nothing better to enjoy with chocolate desserts, cheesecake, ice cream, fine cheeses and roaring fireplaces.Given this beer’s higher ABV and sturdy character, we think it’s a prime candidate for cellaring. Find a cool, dry spot away from light sources, and see how it changes in the years to come. You never quite know what will happen when you age a beer: perhaps the body will smooth out, notes of vanilla, oak, and tannins will come to the front, or hints of leather and soy sauce will make themselves known. No matter what, remember that beer is meant for drinking, so don’t keep it to yourself for too long.	",10,4.17,50,90,12,107,34,45,82,7,0,6,30,10,111

Such were the final days of the old empire. Reactionary, decadent, sputnik, stroganoff, weird, and drunk. But even as the proletariat countryside labored under inhuman conditions and the threat of being sent to a futile war in the east, they wisely took the time to slam back an Imperial Stout or two.

Black Metal Farmhouse Imperial Stout,4146,Stout - Russian Imperial,94,Jester King Brewery,"Notes:First batch of Black Metal fermented with our house mixed culture. Naturally, because of its unique fermentation with native microorganisms, the beer is different than previous versions. We’re quite happy with how it turned out, and we’re excited to release it. However, for fans of the original Black Metal, or “O.G. Black Metal” as its known, we feel as though we need to borrow the famous line from Stone Brewing Co.‘s Arrogant Bastard Ale: “You probably won’t like it.” Like all our beer, the flavors and aromas of the current batch of Black Metal are very much fermentation derived and rely far less on copious amounts of malt and hops. This is what we like to drink. We like dry, balanced, drinkable, tart beers with some interesting yeast complexity. We feel we’ve achieved this with Black Metal, and hope others enjoy it as well. There will be those that don’t, however, and wish we’d return to the days of fermenting this beer with English ale yeast, and that’s OK.	",9.1,4.03,50,90,13,73,20,43,62,95,2,40,17,10,95

We took the original Chicory recipe, doubled the grain bill to hit 10% ABV, and tricked it out with all other sorts of delicious Breakfast-minded ingredients including lactose sugar (the sugar that lends Milk Stouts their character); barley malt smoked over local Fifer Orchards wood; maple syrup harvested from trees at Northfield Mount Hermon, the Western Massachusetts school where Sam and wife Mariah met; Steve’s Smokey Double Dark roast coffee from J & S Bean Factory in St. Paul Minnesota (a special nod to one of Sam’s favorite bands – The Replacements, who hail from Minnesota and wrote one of Sam’s most beloved songs: Beer for Breakfast); and for the quintessential Delaware breakfast touch – 25 pounds of Rapa Scrapple, which was added to the mash.

Nicely balanced, with a moderate to dry finish.Merry Monks is bottle conditioned which imparts a special effervescence to the beer and a creamier carbonation.

We suggest storing at cellar temperatures (around 55°F) and away from light.This brew is available year-round.

The Grim Reaper better know as ""Death"" was quite found of our classic Sapient Summer Wheat Ale. When we changed it into a Belgian Style Triple, Death thought it would only be appropriate to bring something from that beer into this beer. So he picked the mailbox, and we weren’t about to argue with him. You can say what you want about him, but that Death sure has a big heart. So anyway...we brewed this beer with a Trappist yeast strain so it is very traditional. The flavors are incredibly complex with notes of mild fruit and finishes with a bit of clove.

It has a rich aroma with a unique combination of aromatic hops, spices and the typical bouquet of fermentation – very fruity. Secondary fermentation in the bottle gives it a unique aroma due to the presence of yeast.

UFO Hefeweizen,4859,Wheat Beer - American Pale,111,Harpoon Brewery & Beer Hall,"Notes:UFO Hefeweizen is an American unfiltered wheat beer. Perhaps UFO’s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head. The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO. Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing. When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.The aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character. This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon. The lemon accentuates the yeast’s fruity, tart fragrance. UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body. The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor. UFO has a clean finish. Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.19 IBU	",4.8,3.43,10,35,9,36,4,16,25,54,0,71,25,27,80

Hefeweizen,4984,Wheat Beer - Hefeweizen,113,The Schlafly Tap Room,"Notes:Our Hefeweizen is a light, unfiltered wheat beer, often served with a wedge of lemon. Made with thirty percent American winter wheat, Hefeweizen is balanced with sweet golden malted barley and Tettnang hops from Oregon that evoke a hint of spice. The American ale yeast is subtle, but the grains take center stage and, when left in the unfiltered beer, gives it that classic cloudiness and additional body.The German Hefeweizen (say “hay-fuh-vite-sin”) traces its history to 16th century Bavaria and eventually came to America with the wave of German immigrants in the 19th century. Although the rise of light lager beer diminished the sales of wheat beers on both sides of the Atlantic, the sale of wheat beers began to rise after WWII, especially in Southern Germany where a unique ale yeast strain fermented the beer with banana and clove esters. In the late 20th Century, the new American craft brewers sought out a lighter style to complement their beer selection and brewed Hefeweizens with the same yeast strains they used to brew their Pale Ales and Stouts.16 IBU	",4.1,3.33,10,15,11,35,11,18,20,32,0,36,22,15,73

A special taste experience is the sweetness, which is to enter into a synergy with the fine dry aroma of the hop.	",5.4,3.82,10,15,21,57,14,17,48,47,2,86,24,60,94

Devil's Heart Of Gold,4771,Wheat Beer - Wheatwine,108,Perennial Artisan Ales,"Notes:The name ""Devil’s Heart of Gold"" comes from what they call the ""Devil’s Cut"". When a bourbon ages in a barrel, a portion of the bourbon evaporates - this is called the ""Angel’s share"". Another portion of the bourbon gets absorbed into the new oak barrel - this is called the ""Devil’s cut"". Therefore, the Heart of Gold beer aging in the barrel starts to absorb back some of the Devil’s Cut and hence the name ""Devil’s Heart of Gold"".

The beer rested in these barrels for 7 months. 204 bottles will be released exclusively at The Wine and Cheese Place.	",10,4.22,45,85,4,36,46,3,53,6,0,15,4,18,95

Manly Men Beer Club El Hefe,4780,Wheat Beer - Wheatwine,108,Atlantic Brewing Company / Mainely Meat BBQ,"Notes:Our head brewer James Taylor* was given the club’s challenge: brew a high gravity Hefeweizen while tempering the typical clove and banana notes. He began with a healthy amount of Bohemian Saaz hops, and a grain bill of equal parts malted barley & wheat berries. Then he swapped the German Wizen yeast in favor of an English Ale yeast, better suited for a barley-wine. The result is a complex yet delicate beer with a soft mouthfeel which warms yet doesn’t overpower. We like to think of this beer as sort of a cross trainer between the classic unfiltered wheat style and a barley-wine ale. *(Yes he does play acoustic guitar)	",10,3.46,45,85,7,53,52,22,81,30,0,46,23,22,93

West Coast Wheat Wine,4787,Wheat Beer - Wheatwine,108,Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom,"Notes:Brewer's Notes: Wheat Wine is a beer style born on the U.S. West Coast in the 1980s (legend has it that the style was conceived and first crafted at a small brewery-pub in Sacramento, California). It has as its progenitor the English Barley Wine beer style. Wheat Wine, as a beer style, is characterized by a massively rich complexity imbued with a tenaciously strong-willed sense of balance. It is a style indicative of the irreverent creativity and unrelenting passion for beer that form the hallmarks of craft brewing in the West Coast of the United States. Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is crafted in homage to the skilled brewing artisans and fearless beer entrepreneurs that have pioneered craft brewing on Americas great West Coast.Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is a heavyweight  this year (2005) tipping the scales at approximately 9.5% alcohol by volume. 50 percent of the fermentable extract is derived from malted wheat, and this lends a quenching drinkability rare to beers of this strength. This drinkability is buttressed further by a 10 percent addition of Japanese candy sugar which lends to the beer a character reminiscent of a Belgian-style Tripel. The hops once again are 100% American West Coast types; this year, though, large additions of Vanguard and Sterling render the hop character softer and spicier than last years boldly citrus performance.

Maple in the Wood,4788,Wheat Beer - Wheatwine,108,Side Project Brewing,"Notes:When we finally opened our production facility in Maplewood in 2016, the very first guest we had visit us to brew a collaboration was Brad Clark. In 2016, we brewed a beautiful little sunset colored beer to age in French oak to be later finished on Pluots and in March of 2018, we released our first collaboration with Brad, Pitter Patter.Brad came back to town for that release, and while here, we brewed this release, Maple In The Wood - a maple bourbon and bourbon barrel-aged wheatwine. We used the flavor profiles and took inspiration from our respective barleywines, but infused the recipes with copious amounts of malted white wheat. In the kettle, we added a large percentage of Vermont maple syrup. We then aged this wheatwine in BLiS maple bourbon and E.H. Taylor bourbon barrels for 18 months before selecting a blend that showcased the barrels and the individual threads in a harmonious, cohesive way.The result is a luxurious, round, rich, beer that lays the groundwork and structure for the barrels to rest. The maple leaves a nuanced hint of sweetness that melds with the notes of bourbon, caramel, toffee, and dark fruits from the blend of yeasts we used to ferment before allowing it to age and mature in oak to softness and balance. Although it’s a big beer - like most of our barrel-aged beers - the wheat lightens the experience and allows it to fall somewhere between our Längst and Anabasis on the palate.

Positive Contact,5073,Wheat Beer - Witbier,115,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Notes:Positive Contact is the second batch of the Imperial Belgian-Style Wheat beer that Sam and Ben brewed a couple months back.

Instead of 200 lbs of apples, Ben pressed 300 lbs of organic Fuji apples for a total addition of 25 gallons of fresh pressed cider, which was added to the whirlpool in order to really bring out the cider character. The amount of cilantro was nearly quadrupled with 4 lbs total, which was pureed with a portion of the cider and then added after the boil was done. The cayenne was doubled, but added directly before the beer was transferred from the kettle to the fermenter in an effort to minimize the burn while increasing the flavor and aroma contributed. A different type of wit yeast was used and then fermented slightly cooler to keep the yeast character minimal and act as a supporting role to the main players the cider and spices. Lastly, this batch was boiled for less time than the original batch, leaving the beer with a lighter straw color than the amberish hue of batch #1.Overall, Positive Contact is characterized by its bright spritzy cider character and autumnal herbal quality derived from the cilantro, cayenne, and yeast.19 IBU	",9,3.85,10,20,31,30,30,10,82,93,0,96,57,79,35
